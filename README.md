# ✋ Touch Switch using BC547 Transistor
This is a simple electronic circuit that allows a small touch to turn ON a device (like an LED or buzzer) using just your fingers. It uses a transistor (BC547) as a switch, sensing the small current passed through human skin.

## 🧰 Components Used
- BC547 Transistor  
- LED or Buzzer  
- 1KΩ Resistor (for base current limiting)  
- 10KΩ Resistor (pull-down)  
- 9V Battery  
- Breadboard and connecting wires  
- Two metal touch plates or bare wires

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- When you touch both terminals with your fingers, a very small current passes through your body.
- This small current is enough to bias the base of the BC547 transistor.
- The transistor turns ON and completes the circuit, activating the LED or buzzer.
- Remove your touch, and the transistor turns OFF, turning off the output device.
